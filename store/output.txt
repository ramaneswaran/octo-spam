  In this price range, there can't be no more option available better than this. Also, the product material is satisfactory including Zip, Stitches.  Always wanted to have bag suitable for 7 days travelling but size of average college bag.	5
  Received product with which had manufacturing defect.  At one place, the stitching was not done and there was gap in outer layer and inner layer of the bag.	1
  Nice product with sturdy material. Happy at present. Let's see the durability of the material.	5
  I am using this bag as an office bag. I travel 25 kms on commuter bike. I was in search of big bag yet light weight . This bag serve my purpose . Got this bag in great indian sale at reasonable price.  This bag carries my laptop, big tiffin , 2 nos of 1 liter water bottles plus few files and yet there is always space in the bag to carry some more items . Bag is water proof also.	5
  Perfect for school going children especially upto class 8th as the book,notebook count is very high till that class.The bag is very spacious with 3 pockets,colorful and is made of water resistant cloth material.It's a perfect buy at this price.Go for it.	5
  The bag is excellent in use and value for money. Will endorse it to everybody who needs a school bag.  We would appreciate some more features to be provided in addition to the existing ones:  (a) Please make the bag available in larger capacity also e.g. the Volume size could be 30 ltr or more - this provides kids ample space to pack more when required  (b) at least three large compartments in every bag regardless of its capacity.  (c) Presently, the bottle holding pocket is just enough to hold a large 1 ltr bottle in place. - either increase the depth of the pocket so that at least three-fourths part of a 1 ltr bottle is inside the pocket or better still attach a strap on the upper portion of the bag above the pocket so that strap holds the bottle neck in place from keeping it from falling out of pocket.  Thanks.	5
  My son is in class six. He loves the bag. Besides having an awesome look and design, it's spacious, water proof and the stitching and material is strong. You will never get any bag even close to this at such a reasonable price. Don't hesitate. Go for it. Make your kid and yourself happy. Thanks Triple A (Always Awesome Amazon), for providing us with such products. Thanks Chris and Kate for a great product.	5
  Very nice and spacy	5
  Bought this bag for Rs 460/- and received it on 26 Oct 2019... however being away from home at the date of delivery, I could not open the package and check its quality.. My daughter started using it since 20 Nov 2019 and within just 10 days of usage, the bag has been torn apart!! I am really disappointed at the quality and feel so cheated.. since the return window has also closed on 25th November 2019, I am totally clueless what to do with this bag.. Extremely disappointed with seller ..	1
  The product is good but chain quality is very much bad chains are broken in just 7 or 8 days I request to the company if possible for them please change my bag pack or repair it	2
  The worst product is this only in Amazon  The zip will just pop and blast open as soon as u just wear the bag and the colour is very bad... I mean on internet it looks very nice but as u keep on using it the colour become black and the  lie become grey and the quality of zip and runner is like they had baught from some trash bor and stiched it..... Hopeless product	1
  Stitching is  not Good	2
  Zip broke after 5 months... I had got 2 bags for my twins in 4th std...bags wre good but zip broke in both of them...May b an adult wud hv not faced such issue but for kids who r less patient n r using d bag very frequently ...zip fastening frequently will lead to such issue..Otherwise d bag is ok	3
  Quality is gud for d price gud back bag	4
  It is 26 L bag, detail received on box.  Actual product received is not good but thanks to management of Chris & Kate, they given me replacement of new bag with better quality of chain. As I requested for issue with received bags, immediately they sent new bag with better chain quality. I hope company need to implement good chain with each supply.   Bag quality is very good for use of girls or boys. My daughter using for std. 6	5
  Not the standard one....size is okay but inside cloth is very low quality...not worth	3
  Looks make no sense if you product is not endured to last long. I bought it on September 10 and return window closed on October 10. But on Oct 14 both stripes are torn apart.. Wastage. Chris and Kate doesn't stand anywhere in front of wildcraft and sky bags.. Guys don't go for this bag but spend couple of hundred rupees more and go for wildcraft.	2
  An absolutely great product at a very reasonable price. The recipient of this gift, a 17-year old niece was very delighted indeed. I'll spread a good word about this marvellous bag.	5
  The bag was delivered on 2-Dec-19, bought it for my son of 7th grade. Today, 04-Dec-19 the bag is torn. Pics attached.  A replacement bag was sent directly by the manufacturer C&K within a week. This bag is nice and durable. Its been nearly 6 months and the bag is as good as new. Thanks for the free replacement!	5
  Brought this bag as school bag for my son studying 5th class. Plenty of room still remaining. Good quality materials used, got an extra run of stitching done at critical areas for long duration use at local bag stitching shop. Decent purchase at very affordable price.	5
  First of all, i want ro appreciate this bagis for the space it provides dir clothes n accessories. Its a good bachpack for travelling and we can keep clothes for 5 days or so. The matrial is of good quality n stitching is perfect. One can go for it if they are searching for a travel bag with economical price n good quality	4
  01] The overall finish of the bag is good.  02] The product matches with the description given on the Amazon details page  03] Will be very useful for Travelling and students.  04] The quality of Zip appears durable.  Restriction of 5 Pieces may be reviewed for genuine non-resale end-users.	4
  Very low quality. The zip was stuck and is very much not a water resistant nor good for travelling. Yes, it was very light weight that it's preferred to use or buy a jute bag instead.   Returned the ordered on the very next day and got refund.	1
  Hello  went in to buy this product based on reviews but i am not happy with the overall experience.  within 7 days of use the bag is completely  torn from the base as shared in pictures.  do not recommend buying this product. i am returning this hopefully amount is refunded back.	2
  Very very worst product. My son not even used one day this bag, very low quality bag. The bag fully tore from the strap on the first day of use..no star for it. Very much dissapointed.	1
  Quality is good , size also peefect good for school students.	4
  Not even one week of school and the main zipper stopped working, got it repaired thinking its a minor fault. Still after 4-5 days the zipper stopped again. Material is thin.	2
  Awesome product with tough pads and stiches. Durable and long lasting with heavy loads of books. Certainly an remarkable buying from Amazon. Thank you Amazon for this remarkable and undistinguished product	5
  The stitching quality of bag is not good. chain was broken on 1st day had to replace the chain locally.	1
  Very very very very worst product.  Footpath quality bag is better than this. zips are failed . Very poor quality cloth.It tore within one day.Dont buy this. Waste of money.They not even  took this waste bag return. Dont buy this waste product . Cheap product.	1
  It is attractive looking. My kid used it for school but got torn within 2 weeks of using it. Money wasted.	1
  VERY  CHEAP QUALITY ZIPPERS  FITTED WITH. THE MATERIAL IS ALSO VERY CHEAP.NO-BUY RECOMMENDED.	1
  Bad Quality, Bad Product, zero durability, Can't bear 2 kg weight also, don't go with this product. Total money weast, costomer support also very bad, these people don't know how to speak with costomer, Low quality material and chain. I don't want to give single star also. No value for money.	1
  The bag tore from back side in the first trip itself..only books and a shawl was kept no unwanted baggage stored ..by the time i reached my destination i saw one side the cloth had ripped off .. assuming the reason to be old stock or bad quality product used	1
  Very poor quality.Stitches got open from many places in just two days of use.This was not expected from Amazon.Very Bad.This is cheating with customers don't buy this don't. This was not expected from Amazon	1
  Excellent at the outset. It is only hardly 2 days, it is put in use for my son. Very happy. But yet to test about water resistant etc. Recommended. Thanks Chris kate, Amazon	5
  in three days of carrying less amount of books bags bacame like this.waste product	1
  Bag looks are smart and price at 400 range is a value for money. Zip movement is fast and buttery.  Enough space in bag for a 6+ standard kid.	5
  Looks sturdy yet cool..... Good product..... Hop it lasts well....	5
  Zipper was broken. Asked for replacement. Replaced product was also of low quality. Within 2 weeks of usage, the stitches have come off. Not worth one fifth of the price I paid.  Products like this will spoil Amazon's brand name.	1
  Product Received in Time. Ordered it for my son and he is very happy to see the product. its good in Size having 4 usable sections. bag is big in size so it will be good for Mid school students use. Overall Good product.  Well done	5
  Total loss of money. Though my child like others doing classes online ,so they don't have to carry the bag also but still the bag tored badly within a month. What a poor to poorest quality of bag it is. Very very very much dissapointed. Never got such experience after buying a school bags. Total worthless product.	1
  The quality of the bag is too bad. I bought it some days ago & just within 15 days it is torn. I used it as a school bag. Really this is not the way like you send 3rd quality product which could not even stand for 1 year. Even the inner side stichings and threads are loosing. Do take care of the quality please.	1
  It's a nice product.	5
  The Bag that I purchased initially did not stay for more than 2 months. So I contacted the customer service and they replaced it with new bag. It's been 2 weeks since I started using the second one. It looks to be fine. However their customer service was good and responsive.	4
  The colour of the bag makes it stand out in the crowd. In the train where everyone says "Pass my black bag" and causes a confusion, this bag doesn't cause any issue. It's a value for money bag suitable for daily use	5
  Absolutely not for school/ college use. Cloth came off at stiches pretty soon. Didn't last even for one month after first use.	1
  Nice bag for travelling we can accommodate large amount of stuff in the bag and it is also light weight and padded too but laptop section is not good but over all nice product at reasonable price	4
  Quality is just okay. The straps,are too thin for the weight expected to hold in the bag, almost testing off in second week of use. Also the writing on the bag, is a sticker not print, Its all coming out from the first week itself.	1
  Just want share that please refrain from buying these brand bags, when I first ordered this bag had to replace it as bag zip was defective. The replacement bag is torn out with just one month use.Very bad quality	1
  Itz really Big But short... bulky pakka produck.. four big compartments..	5
  Big spacious bag. Cloth is strong & durable. Stitching is also good. My son used it for an entire year, that is a statement in it itself. Normally he goes through two or sometimes 3 bags a year. It is better than some well known brands.  Quality + Durability + Value for money	5
  Bag perfect mentioned in Amazon sites. But no laptop compartment. No carry bag. Below the bag no pad. So easily get damaged. Same colour I got. After one month I used this product was teared	2
  Did not expect this but okay its heavy and the zips are not too good as well. After a while thought to return it but the dates done. I thought of taking this to school but my old bag is way better than this. Not satisfied.	3
  Worst bag. Quality is not at all good.  Zips failed in 1 day.  Never go for this product.	1
  Very bad performance...i have purchased 2 months ago and condition of zip and cloth of beg is very worst..pls dont purchase this..completely wastage of money.	1
  Very poor quality. Wish Amazon retract such cheap products.	1
  Great deal and only place where you get this at unbelievable price and time saved too	5
  Amazing quality, stylish looking very very satisfied with this product. I got the product more than as I expected.	5
  Worst product...   The zip broke the very first day wen taken out to use ..  and the seller is not evn active or respinding to mails  sent.. such negligence ...	1
  This bag is amazing because of its lightweight and large holding capacity. This is my 2nd one from Amazon, I bought it for my younger daughter, she is very happy with it. The only minus point is it has a very narrow chest for holding a regular size water bottle, otherwise it's a very good product	4
  My son is using for carrying his books load to his corporate college. It is baring that goods load.	5
  Very nice bag. Awesome in every way	5
  Waste in every angle, return	1
  Very cheap Material and stitching. It tears off fromVaried places after every fix. Don’t buy	1
  quality is too poor but considering the price may be you can try it. but i shall recommend save money and buy at least 500rs bags not less than that.	2
  Very bad product.. To be honest do not go on its ratings.. And it just look appealing.. But it isn't.. The quality of chain is literally 3rd class.. And the quality is very much bad..	1
  Chris & Kate bag good enough according to the price 👍, try to work on looks you can do much better nowadays children's love to use something it new in looks. Thank you	4
  It's a cheap bag in Rs100/- but Amazon sell it in Rs 500 to 1500 I don't buy any things from Amazon please don't buy in amazon because this type of cheap products sell by amazon	1
  Good but same weight damaged the bag...its not long time I have used I go to out of city this time used bag and same 6 clothing not weighted.	4
  expensive bag for normal quality. It will be usable for as school bag for six months.	3
  Very smart and spacious bag.. Can use for any purpose..  My 7years old is really happy to have it. Its a strong bag.. Can buy	5
  It tore totally at the seams 55 days from purchase. Almost soon after closure of return window. Poor quality. Totally avoid please.	1
  Great Deal for thus price. Buy it without hesitation. Size is also very good for regular as well as for traveling purpose.	5
  It's awesome in this amount, full spacing and laptop compartment is given, it can be used for office travel school college everywhere. Very good quality in this amount.	5
  I love the product, intially I was thinking to go for Other brands but read other people's review which helped to look at this product.  It's really worth to try..  Love the product and loved the delivery from Amazon	5
  This is very nice and perfect . Value for money .thank you very much  amazon for this product .  .	5
  Light weight ..4 big pockets...2 pockets for water bottle..laptop space...worth for money	5
  The zippers were simply not working when the bag arrived. Poor quality manufacturing.	1
  Nice product and in this Price range very good .....very spacious ...can use for travel or normal purpose ....also the customer support is very helpful if you have an issue with the product	5
  PATHETIC QUALITY,not expected from Amazon atleast.  u people r providing USED products to your esteemed customers.   SHAME	1
  No doubt the design of the bag was very nice!!  But sad to say the quality of the bag is very bad.  The zips broke out within a week!!  The company definitely needs to use stonger zip chains of a better company..	1
  Prodecat not good	1
  Quality is not good returning the product.	1
  If you don't have allergies in the brand you may purchase this. I'd bought it two nos. One for my son and one for gift item. Just Awesome. The outer and inner material, zeepers all are too good.	5
  Very poor quality. Got damaged  within a day. Didn't expected this quality from Amazon. Will think twice before ordering such products from Amazon again	1
  The bag is overall good, but in one of the compartments there are two chains of which one chain is not working properly.  Otherwise the other chains are functioning nicely.	3
  Average product. not too good and not too bad.  The colour sticker has vanished in 2 days of use.	3
  Price is OK but quality of the product specially zipping  not upto the mark  Damaged soon after usage.	3
